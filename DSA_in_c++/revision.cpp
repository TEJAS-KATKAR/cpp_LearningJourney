/*
Flowcharts:-
Write the code in flowcharts first for getting an idea.

Variables:-
container who store data.   eg- age = 18;

DataTypes:- 
  int :- used to store integers.
  float :- used to store numbers with decimals.
  double :- used to store numbers with decimals.
  char :- used to store single character.
  bool :- used to store  True, false type.

Operators :-
  Arithmatic = + ,- ,* ,/ ,%.
  Relational = < , <= , > , >= , ==, =!.
  Logical = || , && , ! .
  unary = increment: ++ , Decrement: --.
  turnary = condition ? case1 : case2 ;

conditional statements:=
  if-else statement
  switch case

Loops
while loop
do while loop
for loop
*/

//functions:-
/*
  #include<iostream>
  using namespace std;
  void printhello(){
    cout << "hello\n";
  }
  int main(){
    printhello();

    return 0;
  }

/*
there are two types in function:-
1)local variables:- there are the variables that are declared inside the function or block.
eg: if we declare an variable a=5 in a new function than it is unidentified in all other functions;

2)Global variables:- these are the variables that exist throughout the whole program
                      and can be used in any part of the program.
eg: if we declare an variable a= 5 in void functionn than it can be used in all the functions.

***but local variable is > than globle variable.
eg: if we declare a=5 in globle variable and declare same variable in local variable a=7.
    than the ans would be a=7.because local variable is more specific.
